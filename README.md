## **Indian Trains Schedule and Information System :**

## **Description:**

The Indian Train Schedule and Information System is a comprehensive database project designed to manage and analyze information related to train schedules, stations, and details about various trains. This project is particularly useful for railway systems, allowing them to efficiently organize and retrieve essential information for both operational and analytical purposes
## Data Base Used : 
[1:Train_info](https://github.com/DilawarALi1300/Indian-Railway-Management-project/blob/main/train_info.csv) : Contains information about trains, including train number, name, source station, and destination station.

[2:Train_schedule](https://github.com/DilawarALi1300/Indian-Railway-Management-project/blob/main/train_schedule.csv):Stores details about the schedule for each train, including arrival and departure times, distances, and days of operation.

## **Tools Used :** 
MySQL

## Queries and Analysis

A series of SQL queries have been developed to perform various analyses on the Indian Railways database. The queries cover aspects such as total trains, average distances, travel times, common routes, and more. These analyses provide valuable insights into the functioning of the railway system.

## Questions Explored

1.  Total number of unique stations.
2.  Total number of trains in the database.
3.  Trains covering the maximum distance.
4.  Average distance traveled by each train.
5.  Trains with the longest travel time.
6.  Number of trains passing through each station.
7.  Average percentage of stops at each station for a given train.
8.  Trains with the highest number of stops.
9.  Total travel time for each train.
10.  Most common routes based on source and destination stations.

# Conclusion

The Indian Railways SQL Project provides a comprehensive analysis of the railway system through the lens of a well-structured database and insightful SQL queries. By examining various aspects such as train schedules, distances, travel times, and stops, we gain valuable insights into the functioning of the Indian Railways.

The database, named [Indian_Railways](https://github.com/DilawarALi1300/Indian-Railway-Management-project/blob/main/Indian%20Railways%20Management.sql), is designed to store essential information about trains and their schedules. The SQL queries developed for this project enable users to explore and analyze different facets of the data, providing a deeper understanding of the railway operations.

Throughout the project, we addressed diverse questions, including the total number of trains, average distances traveled, trains covering the maximum distance, and the most common routes based on source and destination stations. These analyses offer stakeholders, railway operators, and enthusiasts a valuable resource for making informed decisions, optimizing operations, and understanding the dynamics of the Indian Railways system.

As the project evolves, there is room for further exploration, improvement, and contribution. Whether for academic purposes, operational enhancements, or simply out of curiosity, the Indian Railways SQL Project stands as a foundation for ongoing discussions, analyses, and advancements within the realm of railway management and analytics.
